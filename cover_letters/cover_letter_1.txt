Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Robotics Software Engineer position at your company. With a solid background in robot control software development and ROS-based systems, I believe I can contribute significantly to your logistics robotics project.

I will graduate with a Master’s degree in Robotics in September 2025, and I have over five years of hands-on experience working with ROS, C++, Linux/Ubuntu, and mobile robot software development.

In previous projects, I have gained deep experience in integrating and fine-tuning modules such as SLAM (including Google Cartographer), localization, and motion planning algorithms like Timed Elastic Band and DWA into enterprise-level robots. These robots were deployed in postal factories, offices, restaurants.

Beyond simply using existing tools, I also developed my own motion planning algorithm for mobile robots based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments.

These experiences have strengthened my ability to build scalable and production-ready robotic solutions that align well with your mission.

In addition to my technical background, I am fluent in English and plan to move to Japan long-term. I am currently learning Japanese to better collaborate in international teams. I am truly excited by your company’s vision and would love to contribute my expertise in robot control, fleet management, and ROS system integration.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can support your team in building intelligent logistics robot solutions.

Best regards,
Nguyen Ngoc Huy
